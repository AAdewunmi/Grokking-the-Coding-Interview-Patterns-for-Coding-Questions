# Project Title:

Patterns for Coding Interview Questions


## 1. Project Description:

This repository contains a list of "must know" patterns for coding interview questions. 

This list and its contents are based on a popular resource - "Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions"

I am an advocate for learning-in-public, so I thought I'd create a public repository to keep all my learning on the subject.

Hope you find it useful (as soon as I complete it!) üòé
