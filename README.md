# Project Title:

Grokking the Coding Interview Patterns: Includes Topic Tutorials Plus LeetCode Questions & Solutions in JAVA ☕️


## 1. Project Description:

This repository contains topic tutorials on "must know" coding interview patterns, their associated LeetCode questions 
and solutions in Java programming language. It is based on "Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions" 
by Design Gurus. 

Each section is structured as follows:
    
    * Bitwise XOR

        L Bitwise_XOR_Tutorial.txt (What is Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)?)
        
        L Problem_1_Single_Number.java (LeetCode Question: 136. Single Number)

        L Problem_2_Two_Single_Numbers.java (LeetCode Question: 260. Single Number III)

        L Problem_3_Complement_Of_Base_10_Number.java (LeetCode Question: 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer)

        L Problem_4_Flip_And_Invert_An_Image.java (LeetCode Question: 832. Flipping an Image)


## 2. Prerequisites:

Before solving Leetcode problems, make sure you are familiar with the following:

    * Fundermentals of programming in Java Language
    
    * Collections in Java 
        
        L Interfaces: Set, List, Queue, Deque 

        L Classes: ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, etc.

    * Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

        L Data Structure: Stack, Queue, Graph, Tree, etc.

        L Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, etc
