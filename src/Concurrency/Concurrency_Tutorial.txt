Concurrency
===========

- Introduction:
===============

    Concurrency refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously or in overlapping time periods.
    Concurrency is essential for optimizing the performance and efficiency of programs, especially in environments where
    resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O are shared among multiple tasks. In the context of a coding interview question,
    concurrency refers to the ability to design and implement solutions that can handle multiple tasks or operations simultaneously.
    Interviewers might ask candidates to write pseudocode or Java code to solve problems involving concurrent processes,
    while also considering time and space complexity.

- Key Concepts:
===============

    1. Concurrency Mechanisms:
        - Threads: Units of execution within a program.
        - Synchronization Primitives: Tools such as locks, semaphores, and condition variables used to manage access to
            shared resources.

    2. Concurrency Patterns:
        - Producer-Consumer: One set of threads produces data while another set consumes it.
        - Readers-Writers: Multiple readers can access the resource concurrently, but writers require exclusive access.
        - Fork-Join: Divide a task into subtasks that can be processed in parallel and then combine the results.

    3. Challenges:
        - Deadlocks: Situations where threads are stuck waiting for each other indefinitely.
        - Race Conditions: Occur when multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously leading to inconsistent results.
        - Starvation: When a thread never gets CPU time or access to resources.

    * Problem Statement:
    --------------------

    Implement a thread-safe bounded blocking queue using Java that supports the operations `enqueue` and `dequeue`.
    The queue should block the enqueuing thread if the queue is full and block the dequeuing thread if the queue is empty.

    * Pseudocode:
    -------------

        class BoundedBlockingQueue {
            private Queue<Integer> queue;
            private int capacity;
            private Lock lock;
            private Condition notFull;
            private Condition notEmpty;

            BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity) {
                this.queue = new LinkedList<>();
                this.capacity = capacity;
                this.lock = new ReentrantLock();
                this.notFull = lock.newCondition();
                this.notEmpty = lock.newCondition();
            }

            void enqueue(int item) {
                lock.lock();
                try {
                    while (queue.size() == capacity) {
                        notFull.await();
                    }
                    queue.add(item);
                    notEmpty.signalAll();
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock();
                }
            }

            int dequeue() {
                lock.lock();
                try {
                    while (queue.isEmpty()) {
                        notEmpty.await();
                    }
                    int item = queue.remove();
                    notFull.signalAll();
                    return item;
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock();
                }
            }
        }

    * Java Code:
    ------------

        import java.util.LinkedList;
        import java.util.Queue;
        import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
        import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
        import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

        public class BoundedBlockingQueue {
            private Queue<Integer> queue;
            private int capacity;
            private Lock lock;
            private Condition notFull;
            private Condition notEmpty;

            public BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity) {
                this.queue = new LinkedList<>();
                this.capacity = capacity;
                this.lock = new ReentrantLock();
                this.notFull = lock.newCondition();
                this.notEmpty = lock.newCondition();
            }

            public void enqueue(int item) throws InterruptedException {
                lock.lock();
                try {
                    while (queue.size() == capacity) {
                        notFull.await();
                    }
                    queue.add(item);
                    notEmpty.signalAll();
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock();
                }
            }

            public int dequeue() throws InterruptedException {
                lock.lock();
                try {
                    while (queue.isEmpty()) {
                        notEmpty.await();
                    }
                    int item = queue.remove();
                    notFull.signalAll();
                    return item;
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock();
                }
            }
        }

    * Time and Space Complexity:
    ----------------------------

        Time Complexity:
        - `enqueue()`: O(1) - Adding an element to the queue is a constant-time operation.
        - `dequeue()`: O(1) - Removing an element from the queue is a constant-time operation.

        Space Complexity:
        - The space complexity is O(n) where n is the capacity of the queue. The queue stores up to `n` elements, and
            additional space is used for locks and condition variables.

    * Considerations for Concurrency in Coding Interviews:
    -------------------------------------------------------

        1. Thread Safety: Ensure your code handles concurrent access correctly, avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.
        2. Synchronization: Use appropriate synchronization primitives to manage access to shared resources. In Java, this
            typically involves using `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`, `Condition`, or higher-level constructs from `java.util.concurrent`.
        3. Performance: Consider the overhead of synchronization and aim to minimize contention between threads. For example,
            avoid holding locks longer than necessary.
        4. Correctness: Ensure your solution meets the requirements of the problem, including proper handling of edge cases such as
            full or empty buffers.

- Example Concurrency Problem: LeetCode Question 1226. The Dining Philosophers
===============================================================================

    The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic example of synchronization issues in concurrent programming. To solve this problem,
    we need to ensure that no philosopher starves and that the system avoids deadlocks (ChatGPT coded the solution 🤖).

    * Solution Explanation:
    -----------------------

    One common approach to solve this problem is to enforce an ordering on the acquisition of forks to prevent circular wait conditions
    that could lead to a deadlock. Here, we can impose an order by making each philosopher pick up the lower-numbered fork first, and
    then the higher-numbered fork. This ensures that there is no circular wait.

    * Java Implementation:
    ----------------------

    Here's the Java implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem using the above strategy:

        import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
        import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

        public class DiningPhilosophers {

            private final Lock[] forks = new ReentrantLock[5];

            public DiningPhilosophers() {
                for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    forks[i] = new ReentrantLock();
                }
            }

            public void wantsToEat(int philosopher,
                                   Runnable pickLeftFork,
                                   Runnable pickRightFork,
                                   Runnable eat,
                                   Runnable putLeftFork,
                                   Runnable putRightFork) throws InterruptedException {
                int leftFork = philosopher;
                int rightFork = (philosopher + 1) % 5;

                // Pick forks in a globally consistent order to avoid deadlocks
                if (philosopher % 2 == 0) {
                    forks[leftFork].lock();
                    pickLeftFork.run();
                    forks[rightFork].lock();
                    pickRightFork.run();
                } else {
                    forks[rightFork].lock();
                    pickRightFork.run();
                    forks[leftFork].lock();
                    pickLeftFork.run();
                }

                // Eat
                eat.run();

                // Put down forks in the reverse order of picking up
                if (philosopher % 2 == 0) {
                    putRightFork.run();
                    forks[rightFork].unlock();
                    putLeftFork.run();
                    forks[leftFork].unlock();
                } else {
                    putLeftFork.run();
                    forks[leftFork].unlock();
                    putRightFork.run();
                    forks[rightFork].unlock();
                }
            }
        }

    * Explanation:
    --------------

        1. Lock Array: We use an array of `ReentrantLock` objects to represent the forks. Each fork is shared between
            two adjacent philosophers.
        2. Consistent Order: Philosophers pick up forks in a consistent order based on their ID to avoid deadlock:
           - Even-numbered philosophers pick up the left fork first and then the right fork.
           - Odd-numbered philosophers pick up the right fork first and then the left fork.
        3. Locking: The `lock` method ensures that a philosopher can only proceed if both forks are available. This
            prevents any race conditions.
        4. Unlocking: After eating, philosophers put down the forks in the reverse order they were picked up to maintain
            consistency and release the resources properly.

    * Time and Space Complexity:
    ----------------------------

        Time Complexity:
        - The time complexity for each philosopher to pick up and put down the forks is O(1) because locking and unlocking
            are constant-time operations.

        Space Complexity:
        - The space complexity is O(1) for each philosopher since we only store references to the forks and use a constant
            amount of extra space (five locks).

    This solution ensures that no philosopher will starve and that the system avoids deadlocks, fulfilling the requirements
    of the problem.
