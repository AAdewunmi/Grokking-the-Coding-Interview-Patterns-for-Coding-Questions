Greedy Algorithm:
=================

- Introduction:
================

    A greedy algorithm is a problem-solving approach that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next
    piece that offers the most immediate benefit. This means the algorithm makes a series of choices, each of which looks the
    best at the moment, without considering the larger problem.

    * Key characteristics of greedy algorithms include:
    ---------------------------------------------------

        1. Local Optimization: Greedy algorithms make a series of decisions by considering only the current state and the immediate
        benefit of each choice, rather than evaluating the entire problem space.

        2. Feasibility: The algorithm makes sure each choice it makes is feasible and fits within the constraints of the problem.

        3. Greedy Choice Property: At every step, the algorithm chooses the option that seems the best at that moment, hoping to
        find the global optimum by following these local optima.

        4. Optimal Substructure: The problem can be broken down into smaller problems, and the solution to the overall problem
        can be constructed from the solutions to the sub-problems.

    Greedy algorithms are typically used for optimization problems and often provide efficient solutions. However, they do
    not always yield the optimal solution. The success of a greedy algorithm depends on the problem having the greedy-choice
    property and optimal substructure.

    * Examples of Greedy Algorithms:
    --------------------------------
        1. Coin Change Problem: To find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount, the algorithm always picks
        the largest denomination coin that is less than or equal to the remaining amount.

        2. Kruskal’s Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree: This algorithm builds the minimum spanning tree of a graph by always
        picking the smallest edge that doesn’t form a cycle with the already chosen edges.

        3. Prim’s Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree: Similar to Kruskal’s, but it grows the spanning tree from a starting
        vertex by repeatedly adding the smallest edge that connects the tree to a vertex not yet in the tree.

        4. Huffman Coding: Used for lossless data compression, it builds a prefix tree (Huffman tree) to encode data efficiently
        by always merging the two least frequent nodes.

        5. Activity Selection Problem: It schedules the maximum number of activities that don’t overlap, always choosing the
    next activity that finishes the earliest.

    * Limitations:
    --------------

    Greedy algorithms can fail to find the optimal solution in some cases because they don’t look ahead to consider the
    overall structure of the problem. For example:

        1. Traveling Salesman Problem: A greedy algorithm might choose the nearest unvisited city, which doesn't guarantee the
        shortest possible route.
        2. Knapsack Problem: A greedy approach might select items based on the highest value-to-weight ratio, which does not
        always yield the optimal total value for the given weight capacity.

    In summary, greedy algorithms are powerful and efficient for certain types of problems, but their success depends on the
    problem meeting specific properties that ensure a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution.

    * Pseudocode:
    -------------

    Here's a general pseudocode template for a greedy algorithm. This template can be adapted for various problems by
    customizing the selection of the best candidate and the feasibility check.

        function GreedyAlgorithm(problem):
            Initialize solution to an empty set or a suitable starting value
            while problem is not solved:
                candidate = SelectBestCandidate(problem)
                if Feasible(solution, candidate):
                    solution = solution + candidate
                problem = UpdateProblem(problem, candidate)
            return solution

        function SelectBestCandidate(problem):
            // Implementation depends on the specific problem
            // This function should return the most promising candidate at the current step

        function Feasible(solution, candidate):
            // Implementation depends on the specific problem
            // This function should check if adding the candidate to the solution is feasible

        function UpdateProblem(problem, candidate):
            // Implementation depends on the specific problem
            // This function should update the problem state after a candidate has been chosen

    1. Pseudocode Example: Coin Change Problem:
    -------------------------------------------

    Here is the pseudocode for the Coin Change Problem, where the goal is to make a given amount using the fewest number
    of coins of specified denominations.

        function CoinChangeGreedy(amount, denominations):
            // Sort the denominations in descending order
            Sort(denominations in descending order)
            Initialize coins_used to an empty list
            Initialize remaining_amount to amount

            for each coin in denominations:
                while coin <= remaining_amount:
                    Add coin to coins_used
                    remaining_amount = remaining_amount - coin

            if remaining_amount > 0:
                return "Change cannot be made with the given denominations"
            else:
                return coins_used

    2. Pseudocode Example: Activity Selection Problem:
    --------------------------------------------------
    Here is the pseudocode for the Activity Selection Problem, where the goal is to select the maximum number of
    non-overlapping activities from a given set.

        function ActivitySelection(activities):
            // Sort activities by their finishing times
            Sort(activities by finishing time)
            Initialize selected_activities to an empty list
            Initialize last_finish_time to 0

            for each activity in activities:
                if activity.start_time >= last_finish_time:
                    Add activity to selected_activities
                    last_finish_time = activity.finish_time

            return selected_activities

    In these examples:

        - `SelectBestCandidate` corresponds to choosing the next largest denomination in the Coin Change Problem or the next
            activity with the earliest finish time in the Activity Selection Problem.
        - `Feasible` corresponds to checking if adding the candidate is within the remaining amount or doesn't overlap with
            previously selected activities.
        - `UpdateProblem` adjusts the remaining amount or updates the list of activities to reflect the inclusion of the
            selected candidate.

Greedy Algorithm Example LeetCode Problem: 881. Boats to Save People
====================================================================

    To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of boats required to carry all the people given their weights and
    the boat weight limit, you can use a greedy algorithm. The key idea is to try to pair the heaviest person who can be
    paired with the lightest person, and if not possible, place the heaviest person alone in a boat (ChatGPT coded the solution 🤖).

    Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this algorithm in Java:

        1. Sort the array: Sorting helps in efficiently pairing the heaviest and the lightest person.
        2. Use two pointers: One starting from the beginning (lightest) and one from the end (heaviest) of the sorted array.
        3. Pairing decision: Try to pair the heaviest and the lightest person. If their combined weight is within the limit, use one boat for both; otherwise, use one boat for the heaviest person alone.
        4. Move the pointers accordingly: If paired, move both pointers inward; if not, move only the pointer for the heaviest person.

    - Here's the Java code implementing this approach:
    ---------------------------------------------------

        import java.util.Arrays;

        public class BoatRescue {
            public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
                Arrays.sort(people);
                int left = 0;
                int right = people.length - 1;
                int boats = 0;

                while (left <= right) {
                    // If the lightest and the heaviest person can share a boat
                    if (people[left] + people[right] <= limit) {
                        left++;
                    }
                    // Always move the pointer for the heaviest person
                    right--;
                    // In both cases, a new boat is used
                    boats++;
                }

                return boats;
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                BoatRescue br = new BoatRescue();
                int[] people = {3, 2, 2, 1};
                int limit = 3;
                System.out.println(br.numRescueBoats(people, limit)); // Output: 3
            }
        }

    - Explanation:
    ---------------

        1. Sorting: The array `people` is sorted in ascending order to facilitate pairing.
        2. Two Pointers: `left` starts at the beginning (lightest person) and `right` starts at the end (heaviest person).
        3. Pairing Decision:
           - If the sum of weights of the people at `left` and `right` is less than or equal to `limit`, they can share a boat.
           Move `left` rightward.
           - Always move `right` leftward after placing the heaviest person in a boat, either paired or alone.
        4. Boat Count: Increment the boat count for every iteration of the loop.

    This algorithm ensures that you use the minimum number of boats by always trying to pair the heaviest person with the
    lightest possible person. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space
    complexity is O(1) since no additional space proportional to input size is used.
