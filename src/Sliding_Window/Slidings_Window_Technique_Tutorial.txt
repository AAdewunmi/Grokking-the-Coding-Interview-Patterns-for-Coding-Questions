Sliding Window
==============

- Introduction:

The sliding window technique is a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering used to solve various types of problems,
particularly those involving arrays, strings, and other linear data structures. It is a strategy to optimize the solution by reducing the
complexity from O(n2) or higher to O(n) in many cases. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works and its applications:

Concept

The sliding window technique involves maintaining a subset of elements from the data structure (like an array or string) that "slides" over the data.
This subset is the "window," and it can be of a fixed or variable size depending on the problem. As the window slides from the beginning to the end
of the data structure, the algorithm performs operations such as adding a new element to the window and removing an old element from it.
The size of the window can be fixed or variable, depending on the problem at hand.

Types

- Fixed Size Window: The window has a constant size as it moves from the start to the end of the array.
- Variable Size Window: The window size can change dynamically as it slides over the array based on certain conditions.

Common Use Cases

    Finding the maximum or minimum sum of a subarray of fixed length.
    Finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
    Finding all anagrams of a string within another string.
    Solving problems related to subarrays with a specific sum or property.

Steps

    Initialization: Start with an initial window of a specific size, usually from the beginning of the data structure.
    Expansion: Increase the size of the window by including new elements from the data structure.
    Contraction: Remove elements from the window when certain conditions are met (like exceeding the window size or meeting a target sum).
    Sliding: Move the window forward by one element and repeat the process.

Advantages

- Efficiency: Reduces the time complexity of problems that can otherwise be solved using nested loops.
- Simplicity: Simplifies the implementation of complex problems by breaking them down into manageable subproblems.

Summary

The Sliding Window Technique is a powerful and versatile tool in the arsenal of algorithmic techniques.
It is particularly useful for solving problems involving subarrays or substrings with specific properties, optimizing the process by maintaining
a window that slides over the data structure, making it highly efficient for large datasets.
