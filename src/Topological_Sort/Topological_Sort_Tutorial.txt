Topological Sort
================

- Introduction:
===============

    Topological sort is a linear ordering of the vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge
    u -> v, vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering. This concept is used in various applications, including scheduling tasks,
    resolving symbol dependencies in linkers, and determining the compilation order of program modules.

    * Key Points:
    --------------

        1. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): The graph must be directed (edges have a direction) and acyclic (no cycles).
        2. Linear Ordering: A sequence of vertices where each directed edge u -> v implies u appears before v.

    * Steps to Perform Topological Sort:
    -------------------------------------

        1. Identify vertices with no incoming edges: These are the starting points since no other vertices depend on them.
        2. Remove the vertex and its outgoing edges from the graph**: Add the vertex to the topological ordering.
        3. Repeat the process: Continue with the vertices that now have no incoming edges until all vertices are processed.

- Algorithms:
=============

    There are two primary algorithms for performing a topological sort:

    1. Kahn's Algorithm:
    --------------------

        - Uses a queue to process vertices with no incoming edges.
        - Repeatedly removes vertices with no incoming edges, adds them to the ordering, and decreases the in-degree of their neighbors.
        - Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

        * Here is a Java implementation of topological sort using Kahn's Algorithm.
            This approach uses a queue to process vertices with no incoming edges.

                import java.util.*;

                public class TopologicalSortKahns {

                    // Method to perform topological sort using Kahn's algorithm
                    public List<String> topologicalSort(Map<String, List<String>> graph) {
                        // Calculate in-degrees of all nodes
                        Map<String, Integer> inDegree = new HashMap<>();
                        for (String node : graph.keySet()) {
                            inDegree.put(node, 0);
                        }
                        for (List<String> neighbors : graph.values()) {
                            for (String neighbor : neighbors) {
                                inDegree.put(neighbor, inDegree.get(neighbor) + 1);
                            }
                        }

                        // Initialize the queue with nodes having zero in-degree
                        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
                        for (String node : inDegree.keySet()) {
                            if (inDegree.get(node) == 0) {
                                queue.add(node);
                            }
                        }

                        // Process the nodes
                        List<String> topologicalOrder = new ArrayList<>();
                        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                            String node = queue.poll();
                            topologicalOrder.add(node);

                            // Decrease the in-degree of the neighboring nodes
                            List<String> neighbors = graph.get(node);
                            if (neighbors != null) {
                                for (String neighbor : neighbors) {
                                    inDegree.put(neighbor, inDegree.get(neighbor) - 1);
                                    if (inDegree.get(neighbor) == 0) {
                                        queue.add(neighbor);
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }

                        // Check for cycles in the graph
                        if (topologicalOrder.size() != graph.size()) {
                            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Graph has at least one cycle. Topological sort not possible.");
                        }

                        return topologicalOrder;
                    }

                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        TopologicalSortKahns ts = new TopologicalSortKahns();

                        // Create a sample graph
                        Map<String, List<String>> graph = new HashMap<>();
                        graph.put("A", Arrays.asList("B", "C"));
                        graph.put("B", Arrays.asList("D"));
                        graph.put("C", Arrays.asList("E"));
                        graph.put("D", Arrays.asList("F"));
                        graph.put("E", Arrays.asList("F"));
                        graph.put("F", Collections.emptyList());

                        // Perform topological sort
                        try {
                            List<String> result = ts.topologicalSort(graph);
                            // Print the result
                            System.out.println("Topological Sort Order: " + result);
                        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
                            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
                        }
                    }
                }

        * Explanation:
        ---------------

            1. Graph Representation:
               - The graph is represented as a `Map<String, List<String>>`, where each key is a node and its value is a
               list of neighboring nodes.

            2. In-Degree Calculation:
               - The in-degrees of all nodes are calculated by iterating through the graph. The in-degree of a node is
               the number of edges directed towards it.

            3. Queue Initialization:
               - Nodes with zero in-degree are added to the queue, as these nodes have no dependencies.

            4. Processing Nodes:
               - Nodes are processed by dequeuing from the queue, adding them to the topological order, and decreasing
               the in-degree of their neighbors. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes zero, it is added to the queue.

            5. Cycle Detection:
               - If the size of the topological order list is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph, it
               indicates that there is at least one cycle, and topological sort is not possible.

            6. Sample Graph:
               - The `main` method sets up a sample graph and calls `topologicalSort` to print the topological order.

        This implementation ensures that the graph is processed correctly using Kahn's Algorithm and detects cycles in the graph.

    2. Depth-First Search (DFS) Based Algorithm:
    --------------------------------------------

        - Uses a stack to store the order of vertices.
        - Recursively visits each vertex, exploring its descendants before marking it as finished and pushing it onto the stack.
        - Time Complexity: O(V + E).

        * Here’s a Java implementation of topological sort using DFS. This example assumes you have a directed graph
            represented using an adjacency list.

                import java.util.*;

                public class TopologicalSortDFS {

                    // Method to perform DFS and fill the stack with the topological order
                    private void dfs(String node, Map<String, List<String>> graph, Set<String> visited, Stack<String> stack) {
                        if (visited.contains(node)) {
                            return;
                        }

                        visited.add(node);

                        // Visit all the neighbors
                        List<String> neighbors = graph.get(node);
                        if (neighbors != null) {
                            for (String neighbor : neighbors) {
                                dfs(neighbor, graph, visited, stack);
                            }
                        }

                        // Push the node to the stack after visiting all its neighbors
                        stack.push(node);
                    }

                    // Method to perform topological sort on the graph
                    public List<String> topologicalSort(Map<String, List<String>> graph) {
                        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
                        Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();

                        // Perform DFS for all vertices
                        for (String node : graph.keySet()) {
                            if (!visited.contains(node)) {
                                dfs(node, graph, visited, stack);
                            }
                        }

                        // Pop all elements from the stack to get the topological order
                        List<String> topologicalOrder = new ArrayList<>();
                        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                            topologicalOrder.add(stack.pop());
                        }

                        return topologicalOrder;
                    }

                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        TopologicalSortDFS ts = new TopologicalSortDFS();

                        // Create a sample graph
                        Map<String, List<String>> graph = new HashMap<>();
                        graph.put("A", Arrays.asList("B", "C"));
                        graph.put("B", Arrays.asList("D"));
                        graph.put("C", Arrays.asList("E"));
                        graph.put("D", Arrays.asList("F"));
                        graph.put("E", Arrays.asList("F"));
                        graph.put("F", Collections.emptyList());

                        // Perform topological sort
                        List<String> result = ts.topologicalSort(graph);

                        // Print the result
                        System.out.println("Topological Sort Order: " + result);
                    }
                }

        * Explanation:
        --------------

            1. Graph Representation:
               - The graph is represented as a `Map<String, List<String>>`, where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.

            2. DFS Method:
               - The `dfs` method is a recursive function that marks nodes as visited and pushes them onto a stack after visiting all their neighbors.

            3. Topological Sort Method:
               - The `topologicalSort` method initializes the visited set and stack, iterates through all nodes, and calls `dfs` for unvisited nodes.
                After DFS traversal, it pops all nodes from the stack to get the topological order.

            4. Sample Graph:
               - The `main` method sets up a sample graph and calls `topologicalSort` to print the topological order.

        This implementation assumes the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). If the graph contains cycles, the `dfs` method will detect them,
        and you can handle them accordingly.

        * Applications:
        ---------------

            - Task Scheduling: Order tasks with dependencies (e.g., Task A must be completed before Task B).
            - Build Systems: Determine the order to compile files when some files depend on others.
            - Course Prerequisites: Order of courses to take based on prerequisite relationships.

- Topological Sort Example: LeetCode Question 207. Course Schedule (ChatGPT coded the solution 🤖)
======================================================================================================

    To determine if it's possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites, we can use Kahn's Algorithm to detect cycles in the directed
    graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If we detect a cycle, it means it's not possible to complete all courses, and we should
    return false. Otherwise, we return true.

    * Here's a Java implementation of this logic along with the explanation of time and space complexity::

            import java.util.*;

            public class CourseSchedule {

                public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
                    // Step 1: Initialize in-degree and adjacency list
                    int[] inDegree = new int[numCourses];
                    List<List<Integer>> adjList = new ArrayList<>();

                    for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
                        adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
                    }

                    // Step 2: Build the graph
                    for (int[] prerequisite : prerequisites) {
                        int course = prerequisite[0];
                        int prerequisiteCourse = prerequisite[1];
                        adjList.get(prerequisiteCourse).add(course);
                        inDegree[course]++;
                    }

                    // Step 3: Find all the vertices with zero in-degree
                    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
                    for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
                        if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                            queue.add(i);
                        }
                    }

                    // Step 4: Process the vertices
                    int completedCourses = 0;
                    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                        int course = queue.poll();
                        completedCourses++;
                        for (int nextCourse : adjList.get(course)) {
                            inDegree[nextCourse]--;
                            if (inDegree[nextCourse] == 0) {
                                queue.add(nextCourse);
                            }
                        }
                    }

                    // Step 5: Check if all courses have been completed
                    return completedCourses == numCourses;
                }

                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    CourseSchedule cs = new CourseSchedule();
                    int numCourses = 4;
                    int[][] prerequisites = {{1, 0}, {2, 1}, {3, 2}};

                    if (cs.canFinish(numCourses, prerequisites)) {
                        System.out.println("Yes, you can finish all courses.");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("No, you cannot finish all courses.");
                    }
                }
            }

    * Explanation:
    ---------------

        1. Graph Initialization:
            - `inDegree`: An array to keep track of the number of prerequisites each course has.
            - `adjList`: An adjacency list to represent the graph where each course points to a list of courses that
                depend on it.

        2. Building the Graph:
            - For each prerequisite pair `[a, b]`, add `a` to the adjacency list of `b` and increment the in-degree of `a`.

        3. Finding Zero In-Degree Vertices:
            - Initialize a queue and enqueue all courses with zero in-degree (i.e., no prerequisites).

        4. Processing the Queue:
            - While the queue is not empty:
                - Dequeue a course and increment the count of completed courses.
                - For each neighboring course in the adjacency list, decrement its in-degree.
                - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes zero, enqueue it.

        5. Checking Completion:
            - If the number of completed courses equals `numCourses`, it means we can finish all courses (return `true`).
            - Otherwise, a cycle exists, and it is not possible to complete all courses (return `false`).

    * Time Complexity:
    ------------------

    The time complexity of the algorithm is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices (courses) and E is the number of
    edges (prerequisites). This complexity arises because:

        1. Graph Initialization: Initializing the in-degree array and adjacency list takes O(V).
        2. Building the Graph: Adding edges to the adjacency list and updating in-degrees takes O(E).
        3. Processing the Queue: Each vertex is processed once, and each edge is considered once, leading to O(V+E).

    * Space Complexity:

    The space complexity of the algorithm is O(V+E), where:

        1. In-Degree Array: The in-degree array requires O(V) space.
        2. Adjacency List: The adjacency list requires O(E) space.
        3. Queue: In the worst case, all vertices could be in the queue at the same time, which requires O(V) space.

    Overall, the space complexity is dominated by the adjacency list and the in-degree array, resulting in O(V+E) space.

    This implementation ensures that the algorithm is both time and space-efficient for determining if it's possible to finish
    all courses given the prerequisites.

    This implementation efficiently checks for cycles in the graph and determines if it is possible to complete all the courses.
