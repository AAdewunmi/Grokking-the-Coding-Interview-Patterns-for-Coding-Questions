Graph
======

- Introduction:
===============

    A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges that connect pairs of nodes.
    Graphs are used to represent relationships between entities, where the entities are represented by the nodes
    and the relationships by the edges.

- Components of a Graph:
========================

    1. Vertices (Nodes): The fundamental units of a graph. In a graph G = (V, E) , V represents the set of vertices.
    2. Edges: The connections between the vertices. E represents the set of edges. Each edge is a pair of vertices.

- Types of Graphs:
==================

    1. Directed Graph (Digraph): Each edge has a direction, going from one vertex to another.
        Represented as an ordered pair (u, v), where u is the starting vertex and v is the ending vertex.
    2. Undirected Graph: Edges do not have a direction. An edge is represented as an unordered pair {u, v\},
        meaning the connection is bidirectional.
    3. Weighted Graph: Each edge has an associated weight or cost. Used to represent scenarios like distances, costs, or capacities.
    4. Unweighted Graph: All edges are equal, with no specific weights assigned to them.

    - Special Graphs
    1. Cyclic Graph: Contains at least one cycle (a path where the first and last vertices are the same).
    2. Acyclic Graph: Contains no cycles. A directed acyclic graph is called a DAG.
    3. Connected Graph: There is a path between any two vertices in the graph.
    4. Disconnected Graph: At least one pair of vertices does not have a path between them.

- Representations of Graphs:
============================

    1. Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array Adj where {Adj}[i][j] is 1 (or the weight of the edge) if there is an edge
        from vertex i to vertex j ; otherwise, it is 0.
    2. Adjacency List: An array of lists. The index represents the vertex, and the list at each index contains all adjacent vertices.
    3. Edge List: A list of all edges in the graph, where each edge is represented as a pair of vertices (and possibly the edge weight).

- Applications of Graphs:
=========================

    1. Social Networks: Representing relationships between users.
    2. Transportation Networks: Representing routes between locations.
    3. Web Page Ranking: Representing links between web pages.
    4. Network Topology: Representing connections in computer networks.
    5. Biological Networks: Representing interactions between proteins or genes.

- Graph Traversal Algorithms:
=============================

    1. Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    2. Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

- Representations of Graph:
===========================

  Consider an undirected graph with vertices {A, B, C, D} and edges {(A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (C, D)}.
  Here are the two most common ways to represent a graph :

    - Adjacency Matrix:

        A B C D
      A 0 1 1 0
      B 1 0 0 1
      C 1 0 0 1
      D 0 1 1 0

    - Adjacency List:

      A: B, C
      B: A, D
      C: A, D
      D: B, C

    Graphs are a versatile data structure used in various domains to model relationships and processes.
    Understanding their properties and implementations is essential for solving many computational problems efficiently.

- Graph ADT (abstract data type):
=================================

    A graph as an Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a conceptual representation that defines a set of operations for manipulating
    graphs without specifying the underlying implementation. This abstraction allows the focus to be on what operations can
    be performed on the graph, rather than how they are implemented. Below is a description of the Graph ADT, including its operations and properties.

    - Components:
    -------------
        Vertices (Nodes): The fundamental units of a graph.
        Edges: The connections between the vertices.

    - Operations:
    -------------
        * Add Vertex:
            Description: Adds a new vertex to the graph.
            Signature: add_vertex(vertex: V) -> None

        * Add Edge:
            Description: Adds a new edge connecting two vertices.
            Signature: add_edge(vertex1: V, vertex2: V, weight: Optional[W] = None) -> None

        * Remove Vertex:
            Description: Removes a vertex and all associated edges from the graph.
            Signature: remove_vertex(vertex: V) -> None

        * Remove Edge:
            Description: Removes an edge between two vertices.
            Signature: remove_edge(vertex1: V, vertex2: V) -> None

            Description: Checks if there is an edge between two vertices.
            Signature: adjacent(vertex1: V, vertex2: V) -> bool

        * Neighbors:
            Description: Returns a list of all vertices adjacent to a given vertex.
            Signature: neighbors(vertex: V) -> List[V]

        * Get Edge Weight:
            Description: Returns the weight of the edge between two vertices (for weighted graphs).
            Signature: get_edge_weight(vertex1: V, vertex2: V) -> W

        * Degree:
            Description: Returns the number of edges connected to a vertex.
            Signature: degree(vertex: V) -> int

    - Implementation:
    -----------------
        Here's an example implementation of a simple Graph ADT in Java using an adjacency list representation.
        This example includes the essential operations such as adding vertices, adding edges, removing vertices,
        removing edges, and retrieving information about the graph.

        import java.util.*;

        static class Edge {
            String vertex;

                this.vertex = vertex;
                this.weight = weight;
            }

            Edge(String vertex1, String vertex2, int weight) {
                this.vertex = vertex1 + "-" + vertex2;
                this.weight = weight;
            }

            @Override
            public boolean equals(Object obj) {
                if (this == obj) return true;

                Edge edge = (Edge) obj;
                return weight == edge.weight &&
                       Objects.equals(vertex, edge.vertex);
            }

            @Override

            }

            @Override
            public String toString() {

            }
        }

        public class GraphADT {

                        neighbors.add(edge.vertex);
                    }
                }

            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                GraphADT graph = new GraphADT();
                graph.addVertex("A");

    - Explanation:
    --------------
        GraphADT Class:
            Uses a Map to store the adjacency list, where each key is a vertex and the value is a list of edges.
        Edge Class:
            Represents an edge between two vertices. Contains the target vertex and the weight of the edge.
        Operations:
            addVertex: Adds a new vertex to the adjacency list.
            addEdge: Adds an edge between two vertices with a specified weight.
            removeVertex: Removes a vertex and all edges connected to it.
            removeEdge: Removes an edge between two specified vertices.
            getVertices: Returns a list of all vertices.
            getEdges: Returns a list of all edges.
            adjacent: Checks if there is an edge between two vertices.
            neighbors: Returns a list of all adjacent vertices for a given vertex.
            getEdgeWeight: Returns the weight of the edge between two vertices.
            degree: Returns the number of edges connected to a vertex.

    This implementation provides a clear and functional Graph ADT in Java, demonstrating the basic operations and how to use them.

- Depth-First Search (DFS) Implementation in Java:
==================================================

    Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    It can be implemented using a stack (either implicitly via recursion or explicitly using an iterative approach).

    Here is an example implementation of DFS for a graph using an adjacency list representation in Java.

    import java.util.*;

    public class Graph {
        private Map<String, List<String>> adjList;

        public Graph() {
            adjList = new HashMap<>();
        }

        public void addVertex(String vertex) {
            adjList.putIfAbsent(vertex, new ArrayList<>());
        }

        public void addEdge(String vertex1, String vertex2) {
            adjList.get(vertex1).add(vertex2);
            adjList.get(vertex2).add(vertex1); // For undirected graph; remove this line for directed graph
        }

        public void dfsRecursive(String start) {
            Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
            dfsRecursiveHelper(start, visited);
        }

        private void dfsRecursiveHelper(String vertex, Set<String> visited) {
            if (!visited.contains(vertex)) {
                visited.add(vertex);
                System.out.print(vertex + " ");
                for (String neighbor : adjList.get(vertex)) {
                    dfsRecursiveHelper(neighbor, visited);
                }
            }
        }

        public void dfsIterative(String start) {
            Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
            Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();
            stack.push(start);

            while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                String vertex = stack.pop();
                if (!visited.contains(vertex)) {
                    visited.add(vertex);
                    System.out.print(vertex + " ");
                    for (String neighbor : adjList.get(vertex)) {
                        if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                            stack.push(neighbor);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Graph graph = new Graph();
            graph.addVertex("A");
            graph.addVertex("B");
            graph.addVertex("C");
            graph.addVertex("D");
            graph.addVertex("E");

            graph.addEdge("A", "B");
            graph.addEdge("A", "C");
            graph.addEdge("B", "D");
            graph.addEdge("C", "E");
            graph.addEdge("D", "E");

            System.out.println("DFS Recursive:");
            graph.dfsRecursive("A"); // Output: A B D E C

            System.out.println("\nDFS Iterative:");
            graph.dfsIterative("A"); // Output: A C E D B
        }
    }

    * Explanation:
    --------------

        Graph Class:
            Uses a Map to store the adjacency list, where each key is a vertex and the value is a list of adjacent vertices.

        addVertex:
            Adds a new vertex to the adjacency list.

        addEdge:
            Adds an edge between two vertices. For an undirected graph, it adds the edge in both directions.

        dfsRecursive:
            Initializes the DFS recursive traversal from a starting vertex.
            Uses a Set to keep track of visited vertices to avoid cycles and infinite loops.

        dfsRecursiveHelper:
            The recursive helper function that performs the actual DFS traversal.
            Visits a vertex, marks it as visited, and recursively visits all its unvisited neighbors.

        dfsIterative:
            Performs DFS traversal using an iterative approach with a stack.
            Uses a Set to keep track of visited vertices and a Stack to manage the traversal order.

    * Usage Example:
    ----------------

    The main method demonstrates how to create a graph, add vertices and edges, and perform both recursive and iterative
    DFS traversals.

    When you run this program, it outputs the order in which the vertices are visited during DFS traversal.
    The recursive and iterative approaches might yield different orders of visiting nodes due to the nature of the stack
    operations and the order of neighbors in the adjacency list. However, both approaches correctly traverse the
    graph depth-first.

- Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation in Java:
====================================================

    Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the present depth level
    before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. It is typically implemented using a queue.

    Here is an example implementation of BFS for a graph using an adjacency list representation in Java.

    import java.util.*;

    public class Graph {
        private Map<String, List<String>> adjList;

        public Graph() {
            adjList = new HashMap<>();
        }

        public void addVertex(String vertex) {
            adjList.putIfAbsent(vertex, new ArrayList<>());
        }

        public void addEdge(String vertex1, String vertex2) {
            adjList.get(vertex1).add(vertex2);
            adjList.get(vertex2).add(vertex1); // For undirected graph; remove this line for directed graph
        }

        public void bfs(String start) {
            Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
            Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
            queue.add(start);
            visited.add(start);

            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                String vertex = queue.poll();
                System.out.print(vertex + " ");
                for (String neighbor : adjList.get(vertex)) {
                    if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                        queue.add(neighbor);
                        visited.add(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Graph graph = new Graph();
            graph.addVertex("A");
            graph.addVertex("B");
            graph.addVertex("C");
            graph.addVertex("D");
            graph.addVertex("E");

            graph.addEdge("A", "B");
            graph.addEdge("A", "C");
            graph.addEdge("B", "D");
            graph.addEdge("C", "E");
            graph.addEdge("D", "E");

            System.out.println("BFS:");
            graph.bfs("A"); // Output: A B C D E
        }

    Explanation:
    ------------

        Graph Class:
            Uses a Map to store the adjacency list, where each key is a vertex and the value is a list of adjacent
            vertices.

        addVertex:
            Adds a new vertex to the adjacency list.

        addEdge:
            Adds an edge between two vertices. For an undirected graph, it adds the edge in both directions.

        bfs:
            Initializes the BFS traversal from a starting vertex.
            Uses a Set to keep track of visited vertices to avoid revisiting them.
            Uses a Queue to manage the order of traversal. It starts with the initial vertex, adds it to the queue,
            and marks it as visited.
            While the queue is not empty, it removes a vertex from the front of the queue, visits it, and then adds all
            its unvisited neighbors to the back of the queue, marking them as visited.

    Usage Example:
    --------------

    The main method demonstrates how to create a graph, add vertices and edges, and perform BFS traversal.

    When you run this program, it outputs the order in which the vertices are visited during BFS traversal.
    BFS explores each level of the graph before moving on to the next level, ensuring that all vertices at the current
    depth are visited before going deeper.
    This is useful for finding the shortest path on an unweighted graph and for many other applications where breadth-wise
    exploration is required.

- Graph Example LeetCode Question: 797. All Paths From Source to Target:
========================================================================

    To solve the problem of finding all possible paths from node 0 to node n-1 in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
    you can use Depth-First Search (DFS). Here, we provide a Java solution and discuss its time and space complexity
    (ChatGPT coded the solution 🤖).

    * Solution in Java:
    --------------------

    import java.util.*;

    public class AllPathsFromSourceToTarget {
        public List<List<Integer>> allPathsSourceTarget(int[][] graph) {
            List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
            List<Integer> path = new ArrayList<>();
            path.add(0); // Start from node 0
            dfs(graph, 0, path, result);
            return result;
        }

        private void dfs(int[][] graph, int node, List<Integer> path, List<List<Integer>> result) {
            if (node == graph.length - 1) {
                result.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
                return;
            }
            for (int nextNode : graph[node]) {
                path.add(nextNode);
                dfs(graph, nextNode, path, result);
                path.remove(path.size() - 1); // Backtrack
            }
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            AllPathsFromSourceToTarget aps = new AllPathsFromSourceToTarget();
            int[][] graph = {
                {1, 2},
                {3},
                {3},
                {}
            };
            List<List<Integer>> result = aps.allPathsSourceTarget(graph);
            for (List<Integer> path : result) {
                System.out.println(path);
            }
        }
    }

    * Explanation:
    --------------

    1. Initialization:
       - The `allPathsSourceTarget` method initializes the result list and a temporary path list starting from node 0.
        It then calls the `dfs` method to perform a depth-first search starting from node 0.

    2. Depth-First Search (DFS):
       - The `dfs` method takes the graph, the current node, the current path, and the result list.
       - If the current node is the target node (i.e., `n - 1`), it adds the current path to the result list.
       - Otherwise, it iterates through all neighbors of the current node, adds each neighbor to the path, recursively
         calls `dfs` for the neighbor, and then removes the neighbor from the path to backtrack.

    * Time and Space Complexity:
    ----------------------------

    ** Time Complexity:
        - The time complexity of this algorithm is O(2^n * n) in the worst case. This is because in the worst case,
           every node could be connected to every other node, leading to a large number of paths (exponential in the
           number of nodes). For each path, it takes linear time to traverse the path.

    ** Space Complexity:
        - The space complexity is **O(n)** for the recursion stack in the worst case (if the longest path involves all nodes).
        - Additionally, we need space to store the result list, which can contain up to 2^n paths in the worst case, and each
          path can be of length up to n. Therefore, the space complexity for storing the result can also be considered
          O(2^n * n) in the worst case.

    * Summary:
    ----------
    - This solution effectively finds all paths from the source to the target in a DAG using DFS.
    - The worst-case time and space complexity are exponential due to the nature of the problem, but for typical use cases,
      this approach should be efficient enough.
