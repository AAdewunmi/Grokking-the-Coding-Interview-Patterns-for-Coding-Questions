Unbounded Knapsack
==================

- Introduction:
===============

    The unbounded knapsack problem is a variation of the classic knapsack problem where there is no limit to the number
    of each type of item that can be included in the knapsack. This is in contrast to the 0/1 knapsack problem, where
    each item can either be included or excluded from the knapsack at most once.

- Difference between 0/1 knapsack and the unbounded knapsack problems:
=======================================================================

    The 0/1 knapsack and the unbounded knapsack problems are two variations of the knapsack problem, which is a
    combinatorial optimization problem. Here’s a detailed comparison of the two:

    * 0/1 Knapsack Problem:
     ----------------------

        + Description:

            - Decision: Each item can be included in the knapsack at most once.
            - Objective: Maximize the total value without exceeding the knapsack's weight capacity.
            - Constraints: Each item is either taken or not taken (binary choice).

        + Dynamic Programming Approach:

            - DP Table: Typically uses a 2D array `dp[i][w]` where `i` is the number of items considered and `w` is the current
                weight capacity.

        + Transition:

                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w-w_i] + v_i)

          if w_i < w, otherwise

                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]

        + Time Complexity: O(n . W)
        + Space Complexity: O(n . W) (can be optimized to (O(W) with a 1D array)

    * Unbounded Knapsack Problem:
     ----------------------------

        + Description:

            - Decision: Each item can be included in the knapsack any number of times.
            - Objective: Maximize the total value without exceeding the knapsack's weight capacity.
            - Constraints: There is no limit to the number of each item that can be taken.

        + Dynamic Programming Approach:

            - DP Table: Typically uses a 1D array `dp[w]` where `w` is the current weight capacity.
            - Transition:

                    dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-w_i] + v_i)

              if w_i < w
            - Time Complexity: O(n . W)
            - Space Complexity: O(W)

        + Key Differences:

            * Inclusion of Items:
                - 0/1 Knapsack: Each item can either be included once or not at all.
                - Unbounded Knapsack: Each item can be included multiple times.

            * DP Array Structure:
                - 0/1 Knapsack: Typically uses a 2D DP array (though it can be optimized to 1D).
                - Unbounded Knapsack: Uses a 1D DP array because the decision to include an item can be revisited multiple times.

            * DP Transition Formula:
                - 0/1 Knapsack:

                    dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w-w_i] + v_i)

                  The decision depends on whether to include the item or not.

            - Unbounded Knapsack:

                dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-w_i] + v_i)

              The decision allows for the repeated inclusion of the same item.

    * Summary:
    - 0/1 Knapsack: Each item can be taken at most once; uses a 2D DP array.
    - Unbounded Knapsack: Each item can be taken multiple times; uses a 1D DP array.

- Solution Approach:
====================

    1. Recursive Approach for Unbounded Knapsack:
    ---------------------------------------------

        * Description:
        --------------

            In the recursive approach, we consider each item and explore two possibilities:
            1. Include the item and reduce the capacity of the knapsack.
            2. Exclude the item and move to the next item.

            This approach explores all possible combinations of items to find the maximum value.

        * Recursive Algorithm:
        ----------------------

            public class UnboundedKnapsackRecursive {

                public static int unboundedKnapsack(int W, int[] weights, int[] values, int n) {
                    // Base case: no capacity or no items left
                    if (W == 0 || n == 0) {
                        return 0;
                    }

                    // If the weight of the nth item is more than knapsack capacity W, then
                    // this item cannot be included in the optimal solution
                    if (weights[n - 1] > W) {
                        return unboundedKnapsack(W, weights, values, n - 1);
                    } else {
                        // Return the maximum of two cases:
                        // 1. nth item included (since we can include the same item multiple times)
                        // 2. not included
                        return Math.max(
                            values[n - 1] + unboundedKnapsack(W - weights[n - 1], weights, values, n),
                            unboundedKnapsack(W, weights, values, n - 1)
                        );
                    }
                }

                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    int W = 8;
                    int[] weights = {2, 3, 4};
                    int[] values = {4, 5, 6};
                    int n = weights.length;

                    int maxValue = unboundedKnapsack(W, weights, values, n);
                    System.out.println("Maximum value obtained: " + maxValue); // Output: 16
                }
            }

        * Time Complexity:
        ------------------

            - Exponential: O(2^n) because it explores all possible combinations.

        * Space Complexity:
        -------------------

            - Linear: O(n) due to the recursion stack depth.

    2. Dynamic Programming: Top-down Approach for Unbounded Knapsack:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

        Description:
        ------------

        The top-down approach uses memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

        * Top-down Algorithm
        --------------------

        import java.util.Arrays;

        public class UnboundedKnapsackTopDown {

            public static int unboundedKnapsack(int W, int[] weights, int[] values, int n, int[] dp) {
                if (W == 0 || n == 0) {
                    return 0;
                }

                if (dp[W] != -1) {
                    return dp[W];
                }

                if (weights[n - 1] > W) {
                    dp[W] = unboundedKnapsack(W, weights, values, n - 1, dp);
                } else {
                    dp[W] = Math.max(
                        values[n - 1] + unboundedKnapsack(W - weights[n - 1], weights, values, n, dp),
                        unboundedKnapsack(W, weights, values, n - 1, dp)
                    );
                }

                return dp[W];
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int W = 8;
                int[] weights = {2, 3, 4};
                int[] values = {4, 5, 6};
                int n = weights.length;
                int[] dp = new int[W + 1];
                Arrays.fill(dp, -1);

                int maxValue = unboundedKnapsack(W, weights, values, n, dp);
                System.out.println("Maximum value obtained: " + maxValue); // Output: 16
            }
        }

        * Time Complexity
            - Polynomial: O(n . W) due to memoization reducing redundant calculations.
        * Space Complexity
            - Linear: O(W) for the memoization array, plus O(n) for the recursion stack depth.

    3. Bottom-Up Approach for Unbounded Knapsack:
    ---------------------------------------------

        * Description:
        --------------

            The bottom-up approach builds the solution iteratively from smaller subproblems to the overall problem.

        * Bottom-up Algorithm:
        ----------------------

            public class UnboundedKnapsackBottomUp {

                public static int unboundedKnapsack(int W, int[] weights, int[] values) {
                    int n = weights.length;
                    int[] dp = new int[W + 1];

                    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
                        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                            if (weights[i] <= w) {
                                dp[w] = Math.max(dp[w], dp[w - weights[i]] + values[i]);
                            }
                        }
                    }

                    return dp[W];
                }

                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    int W = 8;
                    int[] weights = {2, 3, 4};
                    int[] values = {4, 5, 6};

                    int maxValue = unboundedKnapsack(W, weights, values);
                    System.out.println("Maximum value obtained: " + maxValue); // Output: 16
                }
            }

            * Time Complexity:
            ------------------

                - Polynomial: O(n . W) because it iterates over all capacities and items.
            * Space Complexity:
            -------------------

                - Linear: O(W) for the DP array.

            * Summary:
            ----------

                - Recursive Approach:

                  - Time Complexity: O(2^n)
                  - Space Complexity: O(n)

                - Top-down Dynamic Programming Approach

                  - Time Complexity: O(n . W)
                  - Space Complexity: O(W) for memoization + O(n) recursion stack depth

                - Bottom-up Dynamic Programming Approach

                  - Time Complexity: O(n . W)
                  - Space Complexity: O(W)

            The bottom-up approach is generally preferred due to its simplicity and efficiency in both time and space.

- Unbounded Knapsack Example LeetCode Question: 322. Coin Change
=================================================================

    To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins needed to make up a given amount using an infinite
    number of each kind of coin, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here, we will use a bottom-up dynamic
    programming technique (ChatGPT coded the solution 🤖).

        * Approach:
        -----------

            1. Define the DP array:
            -----------------------
                   - Create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount `i`.
                   - Initialize `dp[0] = 0` since no coins are needed to make up the amount `0`.
                   - Initialize all other values in the `dp` array to a large number (e.g., `amount + 1`) to signify that initially,
                    the amount cannot be made up.

            2. Fill the DP array:
            ---------------------
                - Iterate over each coin and update the `dp` array for all amounts that can be achieved using that coin.
                - For each coin `c` and each amount `i` from `c` to `amount`, update `dp[i]` as follows:

                     dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - c] + 1)

            3. Result:
            ----------

                - The answer will be in `dp[amount]`. If `dp[amount]` is still `amount + 1`, return `-1` as it signifies that the
                    amount cannot be made up with the given coins.

            4. Time Complexity:
            -------------------

                - The time complexity is O(n . k) where (n) is the `amount` and (k)is the number of coin denominations.
                This is because we iterate through each coin for each amount.

            5. Space Complexity:
            --------------------

                - The space complexity is O(n) due to the `dp` array of size `amount + 1`.

            6. Java Implementation:
            -----------------------

            Here is the Java code implementing this approach:

                public class CoinChange {

                    public static int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
                        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
                        Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
                        dp[0] = 0;

                        for (int coin : coins) {
                            for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
                                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
                            }
                        }

                        return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
                    }

                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        int[] coins = {1, 2, 5};
                        int amount = 11;

                        int result = coinChange(coins, amount);
                        System.out.println("Fewest number of coins needed: " + result); // Output: 3
                    }
                }

            7. Explanation of the Code:
            ---------------------------

                1. Initialization:
                   - We initialize the `dp` array with `amount + 1` because this value is larger than any possible minimum
                   number of coins needed (i.e., it's a form of "infinity").

                2. DP Array Update:
                   - For each coin and for each amount that can be made with that coin, we update the `dp` array to reflect
                   the minimum number of coins needed.

                3. Result:
                   - After processing all coins and amounts, if `dp[amount]` is still `amount + 1`, it means the amount cannot
                   be formed with the given coins, so we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return the value in `dp[amount]`.

        This approach ensures that we find the optimal solution in terms of the fewest number of coins needed, while also
        efficiently handling the constraints of the problem.
